# Contributing 

Everyone is welcome to contribute by opening a PR or an Issue on any of the uhleloX repositories. Read each repository readme for more granular instructions.

There are two approaches to contribution in general both based on the "contributor is king" philosphy: **Leadesrhip is is in the hands of those who do the work. Full stop.**
- You contribute to third party Extensions or Templates. This gives you full control over your plans and ideas. You can choose to either self-host the code or get it listed on the uhleloX repository, in which case it will be vetted _on the first commit_. You are in all cases the owner and fully responsibile for your extension or template. No one will interfere nor fix your code.
- You contribute to the uhleloX core CMS or core extensions. In this case, you get a say on what uhleloX is and deoes, _if_ the contribution is substantial. Please note that changing a typo in a readme or code DocBlock will _NOT_ give you rights to decide where uhleloX goes next. It may however give you rights to drive uhleloX Documentation aspects. In short, you will receive decisive power over the _edits you make_. So if you edit a typo, you are very welcome to call yourself the the decision maker of that particular text. If you expect uhleloX to perform a specific feature, _commit it_. If your commit includes malicious code, significatnly breaks or worsens the uhleloX experience without clear advantage, you will be _immediately, and without chance to appeal_, banned from the project. Ever code added to the core (and core extensions) _has_ to be peer reviewed.
